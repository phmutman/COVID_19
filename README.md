# COVID_19 Contagion Intensity per Chicago's Zip Code

On March 21, 2020, the City of Chicago came under the stay-at-home gubernatorial order due to the Coronavirus Disease in the last quarter of 2019 (COVID-19). As a disease that is menacing the health of the world population, there is a necessity to predict what could be its contagion intensity based on preexisting factors. Hence, it is crucial to take into consideration that health is about more than just physical well-being. Health is also determined by social and economic factors, political policies, the environment, behaviors, as well as health care quality and access.

Therefore, the fact that contagion intensity of COVID-19 is situation-dependent, it makes it not only being affected by the properties of the pathogen -such as how infectious it is-, but also by routines of the host population – for instance, how susceptible people are due to nutritional status or other illnesses that may compromise one’s immune system. Moreover, the contagion intensity of COVID-19 may also be affected by the environment, demographics, socioeconomic factors and motives of administrative polities.

Elsewhere, the application of machine learning’s algorithm of deep neural network to predict continuous values - such COVID-19 contagion intensity-, it oftentimes faces an insurmountable hurdle of vanishing gradient descent and/or local minima and maxima.


With the contagion intensity of COVID-19 serving as the target variable, this study aims to develop a supervised neural network model that predicts the intensity of the contagion of the coronavirus in Chicago per zip code area on the basis of the preexisting factorial data such as data of clinic care, of health behavior, of mortality, of morbidity, of socioeconomic factors, of administrative policies, of physical environment, of demography, of public safety and of education. The COVID-19 specific properties such as positivity rate, test rate, death rate, transmission rate and coronavirus contamination pathways are used to calculate the actual contagion intensity.
This study is structured on three principal components, namely; dataset engineering, exploratory data analysis and development of the supervised neural network to predict continuous values of COVID-19 contagion intensity per Chicago's zip code areas.


In order to surmount the hurdle  of  local minima and maxima, and vanishing gradient descent oftentimes encountered while applying the machine’s learning algorithms of deep neural networks to predict continuous values, this project puts in place a technique of a two-part hybrid deep neural network. That hybridation applies algorithms featuring the utilization of  Swish and Softplus functions and of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) and leaky Rectified Linear Units (leaky ReLU) functions. In both cases, those functions work as activation functions, whereby the latter pair are applied in the second part of the neural network as the former are in the first part of the neural network.


In the case of any looming coronavirus pandemic, the values of contagion intensity yielded by the predictive machine learning algorithms would help policy makers, healthcare officials, medical staff and administrative polities to put in place preventive and effective blueprint appropriate with every zip code area in Chicago, in order to curb the spread of coronavirus. At the other end of the balance, those values would serve as an informative medium for the host population so that they can undertake protective steps.


At the other end of balance, the application of the hybrid of swish, softplus, ReLU and leaky ReLU as the activation functions in deep neural network to predict continuous values, it may appeal to the interest of machine learning developers facing the issue of vanishing gradient descent as well as local minima and maxima along the way.
